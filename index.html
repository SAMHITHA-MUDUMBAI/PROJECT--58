        <p>My favourite hobby is drawing. It helps sooths our mind and help us to release our creativity and express our thoughts.Drawing is a form of visual art in which an artist uses instruments to mark paper or other two-dimensional surface. ... Drawing has been a popular and fundamental means of public expression throughout human history. It is one of the simplest and most efficient means of communicating ideas. My little sister and I love to draw and paint. I mostly love to draw potraits and landscapes.I love to let my creative flow and love drawing. Try it once and I am sure you wont regret it!!</p>
